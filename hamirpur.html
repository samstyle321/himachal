    <p class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">The most popular story about the birth of Baba Balak Nath as 'sidh-purush' is associated with the Amar Katha of Lord Shiva. It is said that Lord Shiva was sharing the Amar Katha with Goddess Parvati in the cave of Amarnath, and Goddess Parvati fell asleep. A kid-parrot was there in the cave and he was listening the entire story and was making noise of 'yes' ("hmm.."). When the story finished, Lord Shiva found Goddess Parwati sleeping and so he understood that someone else had heard the story. He became very angry and threw his Trishul on the kid-parrot. The kid-parrot escaped from there to save his life and Trishul followed him. In the way, the wife of Rishi Vyasa was yawning. The kid-parrot entered her stomach through her mouth. The Trishul stopped, as it was unreligious to kill a lady. When Lord Shiva knew all this he also came there and narrated his problem to Rishi Vyas. Rishi Vyas told him that he should wait there and as the kid-parrot would come out, he could kill him. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidh_Bawa_Balak_Nath">continue reading</a></p>
